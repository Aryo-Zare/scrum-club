### 2017-11-17: Collaboration Tool

As was mentioned at the first meeting, we created a Slack channel/community to communicate within the club. However, there are some limitations on the free plan over at Slack, so following one of the suggestions, we are now going to try switching over to Gitter as our collaboration/communication tool. So, if you want to join the chat, please go here: https://gitter.im/scrum-club/ In order to sign in at Gitter, you either need a GitHub or Twitter account. We plan on covering Git + GitHub down the road, so it might be a good idea to create a GitHub (https://github.com/) account anyway (also in case you don't use Twitter or don't want to use it for signing into Gitter). Important announcements that are relevant to all will still be placed here.

### 2017-11-15: First Meeting

We had our first meeting this afternoon. 90+ people showed up, wanting to learn more about tools and software for scientific computing and research. It is great to see such a turnout, much bigger actually than we had anticipated. Unfortunately, the room was just a tad too small and some people had to stand / sit on the floor -- very sorry about that! The Greepzaal at the AZM (where we will be meeting starting in 2018) might be a bit larger, so hopefully this will not be an ongoing issue. As suggested, we can also try a video stream for the next meeting, but I am not sure how well this will work. I am willing to give this a try though, so keep an eye on here for an announcement.

A few more thoughts: I am worried that some people might be turned off by the technicality of the approach we are taking in teaching R. And you might be right! I just recently stumbled across this blog post on [How to Teach R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/02/22/how-to-teach-r-common-mistakes/). One of the recommendations is to NOT teach R as if it were a programming language. Well, technically it is, but the point is to focus on the cool things you can actually do with R in terms of analyzing/graphing data and not the nitty-gritty details of how everything works. That might be true if you want to sell people on using R. But I am hoping that you showed up to the first meeting because you are already convinced that R (and the other topics we want to cover) are useful to learn. And in the end, I think it is important to understand how R actually works, instead of us throwing some code at you that does one flashy thing, but it is not clear how it actually works. So, I hope you will have the patience to grind with us through some of the more technical aspects before we can get to creating animated 3-d plots and other silly things.

Hope to see you at the next meeting!
